      <h2>Running Improves Your Health</h2>

      <img src="../images/about.png" alt="girl-and-dog">

      <p>
        One of the most significant benefits of running is that it is good for your health. Running is an excellent way to strengthen the heart
        and ensure the efficient flow of blood and oxygen throughout the body, which helps decrease your risk of heart attack and all-cause mortality.

        Exercise, combined with maintaining a healthy weight, is one of the best ways to naturally reduce your blood pressure if it's above normal. Running can also help keep it in check if you have high cholesterol. Running and other weight-bearing exercises also increase bone density, fending off osteoporosis.

          Including running into your fitness routine can also improve your immune system, so your body is more effective and efficient at fighting off germs

      <h2>You Can Meet New People</h2>

      <p>
        Some runners enjoy the quiet and solitude of running independently, but others see running time as a social opportunity. Finding a running buddy or running with a group is a great way to develop a sense of community. You can set goals and accomplish them together. In addition, having a regular running buddy or running group is a great way to stay motivated to run.5

        Some runners also share advice and motivation with other runners in online forums or social media. You can meet other people who share your obsession with running, discover a space to celebrate your triumphs and find help to overcome any obstacles you may face in your training.

          Safer workouts, increased motivation, improved performance, reduced boredom, and a sense of community are just a few of the benefits that come with group running.

      <h2>Running Is Good For Your Memory</h2>

      <p>
      Aside from promoting neurogenesis (the process behind new nerve cell growth), there is evidence that regular aerobic exercise helps combat age-related mental decline, according to a study published in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review.

      Vital functions in mental ability, such as switching between tasks, problem-solving, and memory recall, are better in people who participate in aerobic activity, like running. What's more, running may help guard you against Alzheimer's disease and other diseases that affect cognitive ability.

      <h2>You'll Be A Part Of Community</h2>

      <p>
      Runners share a deep bond, and they support each other in running and many other aspects of their lives. They have shared good and bad experiences that allow them to connect on many levels. Many runners find that their running communities inspire and motivate them to continue running.
